## :warning: Meta: Project Setup Instructions :construction:

This is a Python project bootstrapped from the ias9-python-cookiecutter template.

To get started, complete following steps:

- [ ] Inspect the generated files, check the TODO items, and adjust them as needed
- [ ] Initialize the repository with `poetry install && poetry init-dev`
- [ ] Check that everything works for local development
- [ ] Configure and push the repository and check that everything works in the CI
- [ ] Remove this section

## Getting Started

**:construction: TODO: verify that it works**

```
$ pip install git+ssh://git@github.com:{{ cookiecutter.__project_gh_name }}.git
```

## Development

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.
You can run the following lines to setup the project for development:

```
git clone git@github.com:{{ cookiecutter.__project_gh_name }}.git
cd {{ cookiecutter.__project_slug }}
poetry install
poetry poe init-dev
```

Common tasks are accessible via [poe](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet):

* Use `poetry poe lint` to run the same linters manually.

* Use `poetry poe test` to run tests, add `--cov` to also show test coverage.

* Use `poetry poe docs` to generate local documentation.

In order to contribute, please open a pull request to the `dev` branch.
Make sure that your changes are sufficiently tested,
the documentation is up-to-date and all automatic CI pipelines succeed.
